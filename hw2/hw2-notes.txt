Just some notes:

SHORT life-cycle (#I# Changed from OTHER to SHORT (setscheduler) or #B# created by father via fork() (fork)):

- Change relevant task_struct values.
- Insert into the SHORT array.
- If priority changes, move it in the runqueue. (Don't forget to check if it can be run immediately)


- Run, once there are no RT processes that need to run and has the best priority among other SHORTs
- If nice() call lowers its priority change its place in the array. (Don't forget to check if it's now below someone else)
- If someone more imporant comes along:
	- Interrupt!
	- Put back into SHORT array [without changing its current timeslice].


- If timeslice is used up:
	- Move into SHORT_OVERDUE (with priority of 0).
	- If still has cooldown_cycles left, set alarm (How, exactly??) to go off after the cooldown period, which will revive it back into the SHORT array.

- If finished running on its own, remove from array and call destructors.
- If yields or is waiting for a resource, reinsert into SHORT array with same, partial timeslice.

- Run, once there are no RT, SHORT or OTHER processes that need to run, and it is the most recent.


Other Stuff to Remember to Do:
- If non-root/kernel tries to change OTHER to SHORT, fail it.


Edge case:
- What if someone tries to change SHORT to SHORT?
	@@ Fail it.
- What if only 1 OVERDUE - does it get run anyways? does that cost it run a cooldown cycle? does the cooldown still tick? 
	@@ Yes, it runs anyways. No, it runs for free. Yes, it will interrupt ITSELF when the cooldown period is over to run as a SHORT.
- If parent is non-SHORT, but son is SHORT, do we still give him the son's remaining timeslice? (Asked on pizza)
- After a fork, what does the son return for getparam->number_of_cooloffs?


prio for overdue: how do we force all the overdues into the same list? we can either:
	@@ lie about prio before push: all we have to do is use change the prio before pushing into OVERDUE, and recover from static_prio before pushing into SHORT.
